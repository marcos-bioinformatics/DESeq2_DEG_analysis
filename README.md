# DESeq2_DEG_analysis
Script for DESeq2 DEG analysis and data visualization. This is part of the project that I'm working on Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid. We are conducting a clinical study with epilepsy patients which will be published soon.

Here is the script which can be used to perform a DEG analysis starting from a RNA-seq raw count matrix.

Data from the study will be available when published.
